<span class="i0">With ear that little recked the matin-bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a keen eye to measure wall and foss&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Soldan rode; and all day long he rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Pavia; passing basilic, and shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze of vineyard-workers, wotting not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon trader was the Lord of Heathenesse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day he rode; yet at the wane of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gleam of gate, or ramp, or rising spire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Tessin's sparkle underneath the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promised him Pavia; but he was 'ware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a gay company upon the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ladies and lords, with horses, hawks, and hounds:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><span class="i0">Cap-plumes and tresses fluttered by the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of merry race for home. "Go!" said the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one that rode upon his better hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And pray these gentles of their courtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many leagues to Pavia, and the gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hour they close them?" Then the Saracen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set spur, and being joined to him that seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of the hunt, he told the message&mdash;they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Checking the jangling bits, and chiding down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unfinished laugh to listen&mdash;but by this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came up the king, his bonnet in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs doffed to him: "Sir Trader," Torel said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Messer Torello 'twas, of Istria),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"They shut the Pavian gate at even-song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even-song is sung." Then turning half,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttered, "Pardie, the man is worshipful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger too!" "Fair lord!" quoth Saladin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Please you to stead some weary travellers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying where we may lodge, the town so far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night so near" "Of my heart, willingly,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made answer Torel, "I did think but now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To send my knave an errand&mdash;he shall ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring you into lodgment&mdash;oh! no thanks,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><span class="i0">Our Lady keep you!" then with whispered hest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called their guide and sped them. Being gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torello told his purpose, and the band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ready zeal and loosened bridle-chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode for his hunting-palace, where they set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A goodly banquet underneath the planes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung the house with guest-lights, and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcomed the wondering strangers, thereto led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwitting, by a world of winding paths;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messer Torello, at the inner gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting to take them in&mdash;a goodly host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stamped current with God's image for a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chief among men, truthful, and just, and free.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then he, "Well met again, fair sirs! Our knave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath found you shelter better than the worst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please you to leave your selles, and being bathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grace our poor supper here." Then Saladin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sword had yielded ere his courtesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered, "Great thanks, Sir Knight, and this much blame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You spoil us for our trade! two bonnets doffed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And travellers' questions holding you afield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those you give us this." "Sir! not your meed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor worthy of your breeding; but in sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is not out of Pavia." Thereupon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led them to fair chambers decked with all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes tired men glad; lights, and the marble bath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flasks that sparkled, liquid amethyst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grapes, not dry as yet from evening dew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thereafter at the supper-board they sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lacked it, though its guest was reared a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy provend in crafts of cookery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pastel, pasticcio&mdash;all set forth on gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gracious talk and pleasant courtesies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoken in stately Latin, cheated time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till there was none but held the stranger-sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his chapman's dress of cramasie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goodlier than silks could make him. Presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talk rose upon the Holy Sepulchre:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I go myself," said Torel, "with a score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of better knights&mdash;the flower of Pavia&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try our steel against King Saladin's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sirs! ye have seen the countries of the Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know you the Soldan?" Answer gave the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Soldan we have seen&mdash;'twill push him hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, which I nothing doubt, you Pavian lords<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><span class="i0">Are valorous as gentle;&mdash;we, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are Cyprus merchants making trade to France&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull sons of Peace." "By Mary!" Torel cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But for thy word, I ne'er heard speech so fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead the war, nor saw a hand that sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liker a soldier's in the sabre's place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sure I hold you sleepless!" Then himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing the chamberlain, with torches borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led them to restful beds, commending them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sleep and God, Who hears&mdash;Allah or God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When good men do his creatures charities.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At dawn the cock, and neigh of saddled steeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke the king's dreams of battle&mdash;not their own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But goodly jennets from Torello's stalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caparisoned to bear them; he their host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, with a gracious radiance like the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bid them speed. Beside him in the court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Dame Adalieta; comely she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of her port as queenly, and serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the braided gold about her brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been a crown. Mutual good-morrow given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanks said and stayed, the lady prayed her guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take a token of his sojourn there,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><span class="i0">Marking her good-will, not his worthiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A gown of miniver&mdash;these furbelows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are silk I spun&mdash;my lord wears ever such&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A housewife's gift! but those ye love are far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear it as given for them." Then Saladin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A precious gift, Madonna, past my thanks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;but thou shalt not hear a 'no' from me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past my receiving; yet I take it; we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were debtors to your noble courtesy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of redemption&mdash;this but bankrupts us."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, sir,&mdash;God shield you!" said the knight and dame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Saladin, with phrase of gentilesse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returned, or ever that he rode alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swore a great oath in guttural Arabic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An oath by Allah&mdash;startling up the ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those three Christian cattle they bestrode&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never yet was princelier-natured man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gentler lady;&mdash;and that time should see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a king's lodging quittance royal repaid.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It was the day of the Passaggio:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ashore the war-steeds champed the burnished bit;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><span class="i0">Afloat the galleys tugged the mooring-chain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town was out; the Lombard armourers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red-hot with riveting the helmets up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whetting axes for the heathen heads&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cooled in the crowd that filled the squares and street:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed God's soldiers. At the none that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messer Torello to the gate came down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leading his lady;&mdash;sorrow's hueless rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew on her cheek, and thrice the destrier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck fire, impatient, from the pavement-squares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ere she spoke, tears in her lifted eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Goest thou, lord of mine?" "Madonna, yes!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Torel, "for my soul's weal and the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ride I to-day: my good name and my house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reliant I intrust thee, and&mdash;because<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be they shall slay me, and because,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being so young, so fair, and so reputed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noblest will entreat thee&mdash;wait for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widow or wife, a year, and month, and day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then if thy kinsmen press thee to a choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I be not come, hold me for dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor link thy blooming beauty with the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against thine heart." "Good my lord!" answered she,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><span class="i0">"Hardly my heart sustains to let thee go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy memory it can keep, and keep it will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though my one lord, Torel of Istria,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, or&mdash;&mdash;" "Sweet, comfort thee! San Pietro speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall come home: if not, and worthy knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bend for this hand, whereof none worthy lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Least he who lays his last kiss thus upon it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look thee, I free it&mdash;&mdash;" "Nay!" she said, "but I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A petulant slave that hugs her golden chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give that gift back, and with it this poor ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set it upon thy sword-hand, and in fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be merciful and win, thinking of me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, with pretty action, drawing on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ruby, buckled over it his glove&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great steel glove&mdash;and through the helmet bars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took her last kiss;&mdash;then let the chafing steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have its hot will and go.<br /></span>
<span class="i12">But Saladin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe back among his lords at Lebanon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well wotting of their quest, awaited it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held the Crescent up against the Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many a doughty fight Ferrara blades<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><span class="i0">Clashed with keen Damasc, many a weary month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wasted afield; but yet the Christians<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won nothing nearer to Christ's sepulchre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but gave ground. At last, in Acre pent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their loose files, enfeebled by the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came stronger smiter than the Saracen&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deadly Pest: day after day they died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pikeman and knight-at-arms; day after day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thinner line upon the leaguered wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held off the heathen:&mdash;held them off a space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, over-weakened, yielded, and gave up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city and the stricken garrison.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So to sad chains and hateful servitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell all those purple lords&mdash;Christendom's stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once high in hope as soaring Lucifer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now low as sinking Hesper: with them fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messer Torello&mdash;never one so poor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the hundreds that his bounty fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he in prison&mdash;ill-entreated, bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starved of sweet light, and set to shameful tasks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that great load at heart to know the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast flying, and to live accounted dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One joy his gaolers left him,&mdash;his good hawk;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With tameless eye and spirit masterful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a feigned anger checking at his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good gray falcon made his master cheer.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One day it chanced Saladin rode afield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shawled and turbaned Amirs, and his hawks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lebanon-bred, and mewed as princes lodge&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew foul, forgot their feather, hung at wrist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slighted call. The Soldan, quick in wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade slay the cravens, scourge the falconer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek some wight who knew the heart of hawks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep it hot and true. Then spake a Sheikh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There is a Frank in prison by the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-seen herein." "Give word that he be brought,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Saladin, "and bid him set a cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he hath skill, it shall go well for him."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus by the winding path of circumstance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One palace held, as prisoner and prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torello and his guest: unwitting each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay and unwitting, though they met and spake<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><span class="i0">Of that goshawk and this&mdash;signors in serge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some trick of face, the manner of some smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some gleam of sunset from the glad day gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught the king's eye, and held it. "Nazarene!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What native art thou?" asked he. "Lombard I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of Pavia." "And thy name?" "Torel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Messer Torello called in happier times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now best uncalled." "Come hither, Christian!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Soldan said, and led the way, by court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hall and fountain, to an inner room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich with king's robes: therefrom he reached a gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Know'st thou this?" he asked. "High lord! I might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere," quoth Torel, "here 'twere mad to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon gown my wife unto a trader gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shared our board." "Nay, but that gown is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she the giver, and the trader I,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth Saladin; "I! twice a king to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owing a royal debt and paying it."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Torel, sore amazed, "Great lord, I blush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering how the Master of the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lodged sorrily." "It's Master's Master thou!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><span class="i0">Gave answer Saladin, "come in and see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wares the Cyprus traders keep at home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come forth and take thy place, Saladin's friend,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith into the circle of his lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gracious mien the Soldan led his slave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while the dark eyes glittered, seated him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of the full divan. "Orient lords,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So spake he,&mdash;"let the one who loves his king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honour this Frank, whose house sheltered your king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is my brother:" then the night-black beards<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept the stone floor in ready reverence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Agas and Amirs welcoming Torel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great feast was set, the Soldan's friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Royally garbed, upon the Soldan's hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All which, and the abounding grace and love<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"One galley less to ship-stuffed Genoa!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Boomed with bronze throats the happy tidings out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the great tenor, overswelled with sound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whom, as he tarried, locking up the porch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign signor, browned with southern suns,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">No more the questioner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But folded o'er his face the Eastern hood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest idle eyes should mark how idle words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had struck him home. "So quite forgot!&mdash;so soon!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this the square wherein I gave the joust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the loggia, where I fed the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yon my palace, where&mdash;oh, fair! oh, false!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They robe her for a bridal. Can it be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clean out of heart, with twice six flying moons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart that beat on mine as it would break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That faltered forty oaths. Forced! forced!&mdash;not false&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well! I will sit, wife, at thy wedding-feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let mine eyes give my fond faith the lie."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><span class="i2">So in the stream of gallant guests that flowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feastward at eve, went Torel; passed with them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The outer gates, crossed the great courts with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stranger in the walls that called him lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cressets and coloured lamps made the way bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose-leaves strewed to where within the doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master of the feast, the bridegroom, stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-glitter from his forehead to his foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speaking fair welcomes. He, a courtly lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marking the Eastern guest, bespoke him sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayed place for him, and bade them set his seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dais. Then the feast began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wine went free as wit, and music died&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outdone by merrier laughter.&mdash;only one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ate nor drank, nor spoke nor smiled; but gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the pale bride, pale as her crown of pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sate so cold and still, and sad of cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the bride-feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">But of a truth, Torel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read the thoughts right that held her eyelids down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew her loyal to her memories.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to a little page who bore the wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake, "Go tell thy lady thus from me:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><span class="i0">In mine own land, if any stranger sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wedding-guest, the bride, out of her grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token that she knows her guest's good-will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token she repays it, brims a cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefrom he drinking she in turn doth drink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So is our use." The little page made speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told the message. Then that lady pale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever a gentle and a courteous heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted her troubled eyes and smiled consent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the swart stranger. By her side, untouched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood the brimmed gold; "Bear this," she said, "and pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hold a Christian lady apt to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kindly lesson." But Sir Torel loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off his finger&mdash;never loosed before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ring she gave him on the parting day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere he drank, behind his veil of beard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped in the cup the ruby, quaffed, and sent.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she, with sad smile, set her lips to drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;something in the Cyprus touching them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glanced&mdash;gazed&mdash;the ring!&mdash;her ring!&mdash;Jove! how she eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wistful eyes of Torel!&mdash;how, heartsure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under all guise knowing her lord returned,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><span class="i0">She springs to meet him coming!&mdash;telling all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one great cry of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">O me! the rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm of questions! stilled, when Torel spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name, and, known of all, claimed the Bride Wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maugre the wasted feast, and woful groom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hearts but his were light to see Torel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Adalieta's lightest, as she plucked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bridal-veil away. Something therein&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady's dagger&mdash;small, and bright, and fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clashed out upon the marble. "Wherefore that?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked Torel; answered she, "I knew you true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I could live, so long as I might wait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they&mdash;they pressed me hard! my days of grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ended to-night&mdash;and I had ended too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faithful to death, if so thou hadst not come."<br /></span>

<h2><i>TWO BOOKS FROM THE ILIAD OF INDIA.</i></h2>

<h4>(<i>Now for the first time translated</i>.)</h4>
<p>There exist certain colossal, unparalleled, epic poems in the sacred
language of India, which were not known to Europe, even by name, till
Sir William Jones announced their existence; and which, since his
time, have been made public only by fragments&mdash;by mere
specimens&mdash;bearing to those vast treasures of Sanskrit literature such
small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to the riches of a
mine. Yet these twain mighty poems contain all the history of ancient
India, so far as it can be recovered, together with such inexhaustible
details of its political, social, and religious life that the antique
Hindu world really stands epitomised in them. The Old Testament is not
more interwoven with the Jewish race, nor the New Testament with the
civilisation of Christendom, nor the Koran with the records and
destinies of Islam, than are these two Sanskrit poems&mdash;the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata
and R&aacute;m&aacute;yana&mdash;with that unchanging and teeming population which Her
Majesty, Queen Victoria, rules<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> as Empress of Hindustan. The stories,
songs, and ballads, the histories and genealogies, the nursery tales
and religious discourses, the art, the learning, the philosophy, the
creeds, the moralities, the modes of thought; the very phrases,
sayings, turns of expression, and daily ideas of the Hindu people, are
taken from these poems. Their children and their wives are named out
of them; so are their cities, temples, streets, and cattle. They have
constituted the library, the newspaper, and the Bible&mdash;generation
after generation&mdash;to all the succeeding and countless millions of
Indian people; and it replaces patriotism with that race and stands in
stead of nationality to possess these two precious and inexhaustible
books, and to drink from them as from mighty and overflowing rivers.
The value ascribed in Hindustan to these yet little-known epics has
transcended all literary standards established in the West. They are
personified, worshipped, and cited from as something divine. To read
or even listen to them is thought by the devout Hindu sufficiently
meritorious to bring prosperity to his household here and happiness in
the next world; they are held also to give wealth to the poor, health
to the sick, wisdom to the ignorant; and the recitation of certain
<i>parvas</i> and <i>shlokas</i> in them can fill the household of the barren,
it is believed, with children. A concluding passage of the great poem
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The reading of this Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata destroys all sin and
produces virtue; so much so, that the pronunciation of a
single <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>shloka is sufficient to wipe away much guilt. This
Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata contains the history of the gods, of the Rishis
in heaven and those on earth, of the Gandharvas and the
R&aacute;kshasas. It also contains the life and actions of the one
God, holy, immutable, and true,&mdash;who is Krishna, who is the
creator and the ruler of this universe; who is seeking the
welfare of his creation by means of his incomparable and
indestructible power; whose actions are celebrated by all
sages; who has bound human beings in a chain, of which one
end is life and the other death; on whom the Rishis
meditate, and a knowledge of whom imparts unalloyed
happiness to their hearts, and for whose gratification and
favour all the daily devotions are performed by all
worshippers. If a man reads the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata and has faith in
its doctrines, he is free from all sin, and ascends to
heaven after his death." </p></div>

<p>In order to explain the portion of this Indian epic, here for the
first time published in English verse, I reprint a brief summary of
its plot:&mdash;</p>

<p>The "great war of Bh&acirc;rat" has its first scenes in Hastinapur, an
ancient and vanished city, formerly situated about sixty miles
north-east of the modern Delhi. The Ganges has washed away even the
ruins of this the metropolis of King Bh&acirc;rat's dominions. The poem
opens with a "sacrifice of snakes," but this is a prelude, connected
merely by a curious legend with the real beginning. That beginning is
reached when the five sons of "King Pandu the Pale" and the five sons
of "King Dhritarashtra the Blind," both of them descendants of Bh&acirc;rat,
are being brought up together in the palace. The first were called
Pandavas, the last Kauravas, and their lifelong feud is the main
subject of the epic. Yudhishthira, Bh&iacute;ma, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva
are the Pandava princes. Duryodhana<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> is chief of the Kauravas. They
are instructed by one master, Drona, a Brahman, in the arts of war and
peace, and learn to manage and brand cattle, hunt wild animals, and
tame horses. There is in the early portion a striking picture of an
Aryan tournament, wherein the young cousins display their skill,
"highly arrayed, amid vast crowds," and Arjuna especially
distinguishes himself. Clad in golden mail, he shows amazing feats
with sword and bow. He shoots twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a
buffalo-horn while his chariot whirls along; he throws the "chakra,"
or sharp quoit, without once missing his victim; and, after winning
the prizes, kneels respectfully at the feet of his instructor to
receive his crown. The cousins, after this, march out to fight with a
neighbouring king, and the Pandavas, who are always the favoured
family in the poem, win most of the credit, so that Yudhishthira is
elected from among them <i>Yuvaraj</i>, or heir apparent. This incenses
Duryodhana, who, by appealing to his father, Dhritarashtra, procures a
division of the kingdom, the Pandavas being sent to Vacanavat, now
Allahabad. All this part of the story refers obviously to the advances
gradually made by the Aryan conquerors of India into the jungles
peopled by aborigines. Forced to quit their new city, the Pandavas
hear of the marvellous beauty of Draupad&iacute;, whose <i>Swayamvara</i>, or
"choice of a suitor," is about to be celebrated at K&acirc;mpilya. This
again furnishes a strange and glittering picture of the old times;
vast masses of holiday people, with rajahs, elephants, troops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
jugglers, dancing-women, and showmen, are gathered in a gay encampment
round the pavilion of the King Draupada, whose lovely daughter is to
take for her husband (on the well-understood condition that she
approves of him) the fortunate archer who can strike the eye of a
golden fish, whirling round upon the top of a tall pole, with an arrow
shot from an enormously strong bow. The princess, adorned with radiant
gems, holds a garland of flowers in her hand for the victorious
suitor; but none of the rajahs can bend the bow. Arjuna, disguised as
a Brahman, performs the feat with ease, and his youth and grace win
the heart of Draupad&iacute; more completely than his skill. The princess
henceforth follows the fortunes of the brothers, and, by a strange
ancient custom, lives with them in common. The Pandavas, now allied to
the King Draupada and become strong, are so much dreaded by the
Kauravas that they are invited back again, for safety's sake, to
Hastinapura, and settle near it in the city of Indraprastha, now
Delhi. The reign of Yudhishthira and his brothers is very prosperous
there; "every subject was pious; there were no liars, thieves, or
cheats; no droughts, floods, or locusts; no conflagrations nor
invaders, nor parrots to eat up the grain."</p>

<p>The Pandava king, having subdued all enemies, now performs the
<i>Rajasuya</i>, or ceremony of supremacy,&mdash;and here again occur
wonderfully interesting pictures. Duryodhana comes thither, and his
jealousy is inflamed by the magnificence of the rite. Among other
curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> incidents is one which seems to show that glass was already
known. A pavilion is paved with "black crystal," which the Kaurava
prince mistakes for water, and "draws up his garments lest he should
be wetted." But now approaches a turning-point in the epic. Furious at
the wealth and fortune of his cousins, Duryodhana invites them to
Hastinapura to join in a great gambling festival. The passion for play
was as strong apparently with these antique Hindus as that for
fighting or for love: "No true Kshatriya must ever decline a challenge
to combat or to dice." The brothers go to the entertainment, which is
to ruin their prosperity; for Sakuni, the most skilful and lucky
gambler, has loaded the "coupun," so as to win every throw. Mr.
Wheeler's excellent summary again says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Then Yudhishthira and Sakuni sat down to play, and whatever
Yudhishthira laid as stakes Duryodhana laid something of
equal value; but Yudhishthira lost every game. He first lost
a very beautiful pearl; next a thousand bags each containing
a thousand pieces of gold; next a great piece of gold so
pure that it was as soft as wax; next a chariot set with
jewels and hung all round with golden bells; next a thousand
war-elephants with golden howdahs set with diamonds; next a
lakh of slaves all dressed in rich garments; next a lakh of
beautiful slave-girls, adorned from head to foot with golden
ornaments; next all the remainder of his goods; next all his
cattle; and then the whole of his R&acirc;j, excepting only the
lands which had been granted to the Brahmans." </p></div>

<p>After this tremendous run of ill-luck, he madly stakes Draupad&iacute; the
Beautiful, and loses her. The princess is dragged away by the hair,
and Duryodhana mockingly bids her come and sit upon his knee, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
which Bh&iacute;ma the Pandava swears that he will some day break his
thigh-bone,&mdash;a vow which is duly kept. But the blind old king rebukes
this fierce elation of the winner, restores Draupad&iacute;, and declares
that they must throw another main to decide who shall leave
Hastinapura. The cheating Sakuni cogs the dice again, and the Pandavas
must now go away into the forest, and let no man know them by name for
thirteen years. They depart, Draupad&iacute; unbinding her long black hair,
and vowing never to fasten it back again till the hands of Bh&iacute;ma, the
strong man among the Pandavas, are red with the punishment of the
Kauravas. "Then he shall tie my tresses up again, when his fingers are
dripping with Duhsasana's blood."</p>

<p>There follow long episodes of their adventures in the jungle till the
time when the Pandavas emerge, and, still disguised, take up their
residence in King Vir&aacute;ta's city. Here the vicissitudes of Draupad&iacute; as
a handmaid of the queen, of Bh&iacute;ma as the palace wrestler, of Arjuna
disguised as a eunuch, and of Nakula, Sahadeva, and Yudhishthira,
acting as herdsmen and attendants, are most absorbing and dramatic.
The virtue of Draupad&iacute;, assailed by a prince of the State, is terribly
defended by the giant Bh&iacute;ma; and when the Kauravas, suspecting the
presence in the place of their cousins, attack Vir&aacute;ta, Arjuna drives
the chariot of the heir apparent, and victoriously repulses them with
his awful bow Gandiva.</p>

<p>After all these evidences of prowess and the help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> afforded in the
battle, the King of Vir&aacute;ta discovers the princely rank of the
Pandavas, and gives his daughter in marriage to the son of Arjuna. A
great council is then held to consider the question of declaring war
on the Kauravas, at which the speeches are quite Homeric, the god
Krishna taking part. The decision is to prepare for war, but to send
an embassy first. Meantime Duryodhana and Arjuna engage in a singular
contest to obtain the aid of Krishna, whom both of them seek out. This
celestial hero is asleep when they arrive, and the proud Kaurava, as
Lord of Indraprastha, sits down at his head; Arjuna, more reverently,
takes a place at his feet. Krishna, awaking, offers to give his vast
army to one of them, and himself as counsellor to the other; and
Arjuna gladly allows Duryodhana to take the army, which turns out much
the worse bargain. The embassy, meantime, is badly received; but it is
determined to reply by a counter-message, while warlike preparations
continue. There is a great deal of useless negotiation, against which
Draupad&iacute; protests, like another Constance, saying, "War, war! no
peace! Peace is to me a war!" Krishna consoles her with the words,
"Weep not! the time has nearly come when the Kauravas will be slain,
both great and small, and their wives will mourn as you have been
mourning." The ferocity of the chief of the Kauravas prevails over the
wise counsels of the blind old king and the warnings of Krishna, so
that the fatal conflict must now begin upon the plain of Kurukshetra.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>All is henceforth martial and stormy in the "parvas" that ensue. The
two enormous hosts march to the field, generalissimos are selected,
and defiances of the most violent and abusive sort exchanged. Yet
there are traces of a singular civilisation in the rules which the
leaders draw up to be observed in the war. Thus, no stratagems are to
be used; the fighting men are to fraternise, if they will, after each
combat; none may slay the flier, the unarmed, the charioteer, or the
beater of the drum; horsemen are not to attack footmen, and nobody is
to fling a spear till the preliminary challenges are finished; nor may
any third man interfere when two combatants are engaged. These curious
regulations&mdash;which would certainly much embarrass Von Moltke&mdash;are,
sooth to say, not very strictly observed, and, no doubt, were inserted
at a later age in the body of the poem by its Brahman editors. Those
same interpolaters have overloaded the account of the eighteen days of
terrific battle which follow with many episodes and interruptions,
some very eloquent and philosophic; indeed, the whole <i>Bhagavad-G&icirc;ta</i>
comes in hereabouts as a religious interlude. Essays on laws, morals,
and the sciences are grafted, with lavish indifference to the
continuous flow of the narrative, upon its most important portions;
but there is enough of solid and tremendous fighting, notwithstanding,
to pale the crimson pages of the Greek Iliad itself. The field
glitters, indeed, with kings and princes in panoply of gold and
jewels, who engage in mighty and varied combats, till the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> earth swims
in blood, and the heavens themselves are obscured with dust and flying
weapons. One by one the Kaurava chiefs are slain, and Bh&iacute;ma, the
giant, at last meets in arms Duhsasana, the Kaurava prince who had
dragged Draupad&iacute; by the hair. He strikes him down with the terrible
mace of iron, after which he cuts off his head, and drinks of his
blood, saying, "Never have I tasted a draught so delicious as this."
So furious now becomes the war that even the just and mild Arjuna
commits two breaches of Aryan chivalry,&mdash;killing an enemy while
engaged with a third man, and shooting Karna dead while he is
extricating his chariot-wheel and without a weapon. At last none are
left of the chief Kauravas except Duryodhana, who retires from the
field and hides in an island of the lake. The Pandavas find him out,
and heap such reproaches on him that the surly warrior comes forth at
length, and agrees to fight with Bh&iacute;ma. The duel proves of a
tremendous nature, and is decided by an act of treachery; for Arjuna,
standing by, reminds Bh&iacute;ma, by a gesture, of his oath to break the
thigh of Duryodhana, because he had bidden Draupad&iacute; sit on his knee.
The giant takes the hint, and strikes a foul blow, which cripples the
Kaurava hero, and he falls helpless to earth. After this the Pandava
princes are declared victorious, and Yudhishthira is proclaimed king.</p>

<p>The great poem soon softens its martial music into a pathetic strain.
The dead have to be burned, and the living reconciled to their new
lords; while afterwards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> King Yudhishthira is installed in high state
with "ch&aacute;maras, golden umbrellas, elephants, and singing." He is
enthroned facing towards the east, and touches rice, flowers, earth,
gold, silver, and jewels, in token of owning all the products of his
realm. Being thus firmly seated on his throne, with his cousins round
him, the Rajah prepares to celebrate the most magnificent of ancient
Hindu rites,&mdash;the <i>Aswamedha</i>, or Sacrifice of the Horse. It is
difficult to raise the thoughts of a modern and Western public to the
solemnity, majesty, and marvel of this antique Oriental rite, as
viewed by Hindus. The monarch who was powerful enough to perform it
chose a horse of pure white colour, "like the moon," with a saffron
tail, and a black right ear; or the animal might be all black, without
a speck of colour. This steed, wearing a gold plate on its forehead,
with the royal name inscribed, was turned loose, and during a whole
year the king's army was bound to follow its wanderings. Whithersoever
it went, the ruler of the invaded territory must either pay homage to
the king, and join him with his warriors, or accept battle; but
whether conquered or peacefully submitting, all these princes must
follow the horse, and at the end of the year assist at the sacrifice
of the consecrated animal. Moreover, during the whole year the king
must restrain all passion, live a perfectly purified life, and sleep
on the bare ground. The white horse could not be loosened until the
night of the full moon in <i>Chaitra</i>, which answers to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> latter half
of March and the first half of April,&mdash;in fact, at Easter-time; and it
may be observed here that this is not the only strange coincidence in
the sacrifice. It was thus an adventure of romantic conquest, mingled
with deep religion and arrogant ostentation; and the entire
description of the <i>Aswamedha</i> would prove most interesting. The horse
is found, is adorned with the golden plate, and turned loose,
wandering into distant regions; where the army of Arjuna&mdash;for it was
he who led Yudhishthira's forces&mdash;goes through twelve amazing
adventures. They come, for instance, to a land of Amazons, all of
wonderful beauty, wearing armour of pearls and gold, and equally fatal
either to love or to fight with. These dazzling enemies, however,
finally submit, as also the Rajah of the rich city of Babhruv&aacute;han,
which possessed high walls of solid silver, and was lighted with
precious jewels for lamps. The serpent people, in the same way, who
live beneath the earth in the city of Vasuki, yield, after combat, to
Arjuna. A thousand million semi-human snakemen dwelt there, with wives
of consummate loveliness, possessing in their realm gems which would
restore dead people to life, as well as a fountain of perpetual youth.
Finally, Arjuna's host marches back in great glory, and with a vast
train of vanquished monarchs, to the city of Hastinapura, where all
the subject kings have audience of Yudhishthira, and the immense
preparations begin for the sacrifice of the snow-white horse.</p>

<p>After all these stately celebrations, it might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> expected that the
great poem would conclude with the established glories of the ancient
dynasty. But if the martial part of the colossal epic is "Kshatriyan,"
and the religious episodes "Brahmanic," the conclusion breathes the
spirit of Buddhism. Yudhishthira sits grandly on the throne; but
earthly greatness does not content the soul of man, nor can riches
render weary hearts happy. A wonderful scene, which reads like a
rebuke from the dead addressed to the living upon the madness of all
war, occurs in this part of the poem. The Pandavas and the old King
Dhritarashtra being together by the banks of the Ganges, the great
saint Vy&aacute;sa undertakes to bring back to them all the departed, slain
in their fratricidal conflict. The spectacle is at once terrible and
tender.</p>

<p>But this revealing of the invisible world deepens the discontent of
the princes, and when the sage Vy&aacute;sa tells them that their prosperity
is near its end, they determine to leave their kingdom to younger
princes, and to set out with their faces towards Mount Meru, where is
Indra's heaven. If, haply, they may reach it, there will be an end of
this world's joys and sorrows, and "union with the Infinite" will be
obtained. My translations from the Sanskrit of the two concluding
parvas of the poem (of which the above is a swift summary) describe
the "Last Journey" of the princes and their "Entry into Heaven;" and
herein occurs one of the noblest religious apologues not only of this
great Epic but of any creed,&mdash;a beautiful fable of faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> love
which may be contrasted, to the advantage of the Hindu teaching, with
any Scriptural representations of Death, and of Love, "which stronger
is than Death." There is always something selfish in the anxiety of
Orthodox people to save their own souls, and our best religious
language is not free from that taint of pious egotism. The Parvas of
the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata which contain Yudhishthira's approach to Indra's
paradise teach, on the contrary, that deeper and better lesson nobly
enjoined by an American poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The gate of heaven opens to none alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save thou one soul, and it shall save thine own."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These prefatory remarks seemed necessary to introduce the subjoined
close paraphrase of the "Book of the Great Journey,"&mdash;and the "Book of
the Entry into Heaven;" being the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Parvas of
the noble but, as yet, almost unknown Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<h4><i>TO THE "BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS."</i></h4>
<p>The <i>Hitopade&#347;a</i> is a work of high antiquity and extended popularity.
The prose is doubtless as old as our own era; but the intercalated
verses and proverbs compose a selection from writings of an age
extremely remote. The <i>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</i> and the textual <i>Veds</i> are of
those quoted; to the first of which Professor M. Williams (in his
admirable edition of the <i>Nala</i>, 1860) assigns the modest date of 350
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, while he claims for the <i>Rig-Veda</i> an antiquity as high as 1300
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The <i>Hitopade&#347;a</i> may thus be fairly styled "The Father of all
Fables;" for from its numerous translations have probably come Esop
and Pilpay, and in latter days <i>Reineke Fuchs</i>. Originally compiled in
Sanskrit, it was rendered, by order of Nushirv&aacute;n, in the sixth century
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, into Persic. From the Persic it passed, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 850, into the
Arabic, and thence into Hebrew and Greek. In its own land it obtained
as wide a circulation. The Emperor Akbar, impressed with the wisdom of
its maxims and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> ingenuity of its apologues, commended the work of
translating it to his own Vizier, Abdul Fazel. That Minister
accordingly put the book into a familiar style, and published it with
explanations, under the title of the <i>Criterion of Wisdom</i>. The
Emperor had also suggested the abridgment of the long series of
shlokes which here and there interrupt the narrative, and the Vizier
found this advice sound, and followed it, like the present Translator.
To this day, in India, the <i>Hitopade&#347;a</i>, under its own or other names
(as the <i>Anv&aacute;ri Suhaili</i>), retains the delighted attention of young
and old, and has some representative in all the Indian vernaculars. A
selection from the metrical Sanskrit proverbs and maxims is here
given.</p>
